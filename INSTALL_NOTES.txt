# Additional install notes:

# set RAVEROOT environment variable, for example if rave installed in /opt/baltrad/rave:
export RAVEROOT=/opt/baltrad

# compile
make

# install
# note that as super user the RAVEROOT environment variable is no longer available, so have to add it again
sudo make install RAVEROOT=/opt/baltrad
